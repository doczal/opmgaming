        <p class="article-text">It is rumored that OPM Esports is eyeing ReLock, the most sought after free agent this pre-season.</p><br />
        <p class="article-text">"He has an impressive skillset that would complement our current lineup greatly," said Rizal, owner and team leader of OPM Esports. "Our team lacks an ADC specialist and currently relies on me to carry the team most of the time, so ReLock would fill that void perfectly," he added.</p><br />
        <p class="article-text">OPM Esports does seem to be missing a key ingredient to their team, as shown by their lackluster performance recently. ReLock just might be the player they've been looking for. Skeptics disagree, however, citing ReLock's lack of proven results. ReLock is currently unranked on the League of Legends ladder, although expert analysis on his unranked ladder performance points to a skill level close to that of the Challenger league. Only time will tell if said analysis is accurate or not.</p>
